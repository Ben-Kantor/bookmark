## Skill Checks

- **Aid Another:** You can attempt to help an ally with a skill check. This is a **Standard Action** and requires a **DC 10** skill check. On a success, your ally gets a **+2 bonus** to their skill check, up to a maximum of **+8**. On a failure, your ally takes a **-1 penalty** to their check.
- **Monster Knowledge:** You can attempt to recall information about a creature you're facing. The Difficulty Class (DC) for this check is based on the type of information you're seeking, plus half of the monster's level.
    - **Basic Info:** **DC 10** + (Monster Level / 2). This reveals general knowledge like its name, type, and general behavior.
    - **Powers & Abilities:** **DC 15** + (Monster Level / 2). This reveals more specific details about the creature's powers, attacks, and special traits.
    - **Resistances & Vulnerabilities:** **DC 20** + (Monster Level / 2). This is the most difficult check and reveals the creature's strengths and weaknesses.
    - **Associated Skills:** The skill you use depends on the monster's origin:
        - **Arcana:** For Elemental, Fey, and Shadow creatures.
        - **Dungeoneering:** For Aberrant creatures.
        - **Nature:** For Natural creatures.
        - **Religion:** For Immortal and Undead creatures.
- **Heal:** You can use the Heal skill to assist an ally.

    - **Use Second Wind:** Make a **DC 10** Heal check to allow a different character to use their **Second Wind** power.
## Special Rules

- **Falling:** When a character falls, they take **1d10 damage for every 10 feet** they fall. If you take any damage from a fall, you land prone. You can attempt an **Acrobatics** check to reduce the damage by half (round down).
- **Hazardous Edge:** When you are pulled, pushed, or slid into a hazardous edge (like the brink of a cliff), you must make a **saving throw** to avoid falling. This rule does not apply if you are teleported.
- **Dying:** When your hit points drop to 0 or below, you are considered dying.
    - At the start of each of your turns, you must make a **death saving throw**.
    - **3 failures** result in your death.
    - A **natural 20** on a death save allows you to immediately spend a healing surge.
    - If your hit points are reduced to a negative value equal to or greater than your bloodied value, you die instantly without making death saves.
- **Granted Saves:** If you are granted a saving throw by a power or effect, there is **no penalty for failing** it. This is in contrast to the usual penalty for failing a death save.
- **Grab:** A grab is a special attack that immobilizes a target. You make a **Strength attack roll** against the target's **Reflex defense**. On a success, the target is immobilized as long as you are adjacent to them. You must use a **Minor Action** each turn to sustain the grab.
- **Escape Grab:** To escape a grab, you must use a **Move Action** and make either an **Acrobatics** check vs. the grabber's Reflex or an **Athletics** check vs. their Fortitude. On a success, you can immediately shift away from the grabber.

## Combat Flow

- **Surprise Round:** If one side is surprised, the other side gets a surprise round. The surprised characters cannot act during this round. After the surprise round, combat proceeds with initiative.
- **Initiative:** At the start of a combat encounter, each character makes an Initiative check (1d20 + Initiative bonus) to determine the order of turns. The characters then take their turns in order, from highest roll to lowest.
	- If multiple combatants on the same team tie, they have the same initiative count and can choose order each initiative round.
	- An enemy squad or enemy rider and mount may roll initiative collectively, they must take their turns individually but can do it in any order each round.
	- If heros and enemies tie, each side rolls a d20 and the higher roll goes first.
- **Round:** A combat round represents about 6 seconds of in-game time. All characters and creatures in the encounter take one turn during a round.
- **Attack Roll:** When you make an attack, you roll a d20 and add your modifiers (ability score, proficiency bonus, etc.). To hit a target, your roll must be equal to or greater than their relevant defense.
- **Defense:** Each character has four defenses: **Armor Class (AC)**, **Fortitude (Fort)**, **Reflex (Ref)**, and **Will (Will)**. An attack targets one of these defenses, and a role most equal or exceed the target's defense to hit.
- **Delaying:** Actions can be delayed in two ways: either readying a single action for a specified trigger, or delaying your entire turn until later in the initiative.
## Other Rules

- **Second Wind:** Once per encounter, you can use a **Standard Action** to spend a healing surge and regain hit points equal to your healing surge value. You also gain a +2 bonus to all your defenses until the start of your next turn.
